# R-MINI-PROJECT
The Credit Card Fraud Detection Project using Machine Learning and R concepts. In this R Project, we will learn how to perform detection of credit cards. We will go through the algorithms like Decision Trees. For carrying out the credit card fraud detection, we will make use of the Card Transactions dataset that contains a mix of fraud as well as non-fraudulent transactions. 
The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 1  frauds out of 501 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. 
 We will go through the algorithm like Decision Trees.. For carrying out the credit card fraud detection, we will make use of the Card Transactions dataset that contains a mix of fraud as well as non-fraudulent transactions. 
 
 We will implement a decision tree algorithm. Decision Trees to plot the outcomes of a decision. These outcomes are basically a consequence through which we can conclude as to what class the object belongs to. We will now implement our decision tree model and will plot it using the rpart.plot() function. We will specifically use the recursive parting to plot the decision tree. 
We used a variety of ML algorithms to implement this model and also plotted the respective performance curves for the models. We learnt how data can be analyzed and visualized to discern fraudulent transactions from other types of data. 

ABOUT DATASET FORMAT:-

A data frame with 501 observations on the following with 31 variables. 
 Time:- Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. 
 
 V1-V28:- V1 may be result of a PCA Dimensionality reduction to protect user identities and sensitive features(v1-v28). 
 
 Amount:- Transaction amount. 
 
 Class:- 1 for fraudulent transactions, 0 otherwise
